Resources for teaching LaTeX using OverLeaf for the purpose of typesetting solution papers in math

# Process

1. Login to  [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com)  or create an account on Overleaf if you haven't already

2. Create a New Project  
   1. Names in Overleaf can't contain spaces so use CamelCase or snake_case or some variation.
   
   1. You might create a project called *Math265* for all your assignments in that class.
   
   2. A project is a place where you put files and folders that are related to each other.  Overleaf will look in the project for files, like images, that you ask to include in a document.
   
1. Navigate to [Dr. Vance's homework paper template](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/homework-template/xmygvfgdnpmy#.W4RM2v5KjfY) 

   1. Click on **View Source**
   
   1. Select all and copy
   
   1. Go back to your project
   
   1. Create a new file called *HomeworkTemplat.tex* and paste
   
1. For each assignment, create a new file in the project, copy the source code from *HomeworkTemplate.tex*, and paste into the new file.

   1. Name your files in a way that will be useful later.  For instance, *P42Induction.tex* in the *Math265* project would be induction proofs off of page 42 of the text.  Later, if I needed to refer back to an Induction proof, I would know to go to this file.
