Resources for teaching LaTeX using OverLeaf for the purpose of typesetting solution papers in math

# Process

1. Login to  [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com)  or create an account on Overleaf if you haven't already

2. Create a New Project  
   1. Names in Overleaf can't contain spaces so use CamelCase or snake_case or some variation.
   
   1. You might create a project called *Math265* for all your assignments in that class.
   
   2. A project is a place where you put files and folders that are related to each other.  Overleaf will look in the project for files, like images, that you ask to include in a document.
   
1. Navigate to [Dr. Vance's homework paper template](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/homework-template/xmygvfgdnpmy#.W4RM2v5KjfY) 

   1. Click on **View Source**
   
   1. Select all and copy
   
   1. Go back to your project
   
   1. Create a new file called *HomeworkTemplat.tex* and paste
   
1. For each assignment, create a new file in the project, copy the source code from *HomeworkTemplate.tex*, and paste into the new file.

   1. Name your files in a way that will be useful later.  For instance, *P42Induction.tex* in the *Math265* project would be induction proofs off of page 42 of the text.  Later, if I needed to refer back to an Induction proof, I would know to go to this file.
   
1. **Copying Files**:  Instead of having to copy the source code from one file to another each time you start a new assignment consider this.

   1. Go to the projects page and on the right select the download button for this project.  This will download a zipped folder of all files in that project.
   
   1. On your computer, unzip that folder and save the template somewhere handy.
   
   1. Back in Overleaf, go to this project.  Select the button to upload a file and upload the template you just saved.  Rename it.
   
   1. You now can upload the template every time you want to start a new assignment and don't have to copy source code from one file to another.
