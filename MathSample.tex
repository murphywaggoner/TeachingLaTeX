%This is a blank document for homework assignments.

%Some preliminaries:  Anything after a '%' is a comment - it isn't read by 
%the compiler.  

%You are welcome to skip down to lines 38-44 to put in some information, and 
%then to line 57 to start writing, but the preamble contains all the 
%formatting that makes it look nice, if you're interested in how that works.

%Packages are just collections of commands to do different things.  For
%almost anything you might want to do, there's a package that will do it.

\begin{problem}
Murphy wants me to type up some stuff from page 599. And so I'm going to include Figure \ref{fig:Jam1}.

\begin{proof}
Let's include an image first, just for fun.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Week1Jamie1.jpg}
    \caption{8" x 11" mixed media collage}
    \label{fig:Jam1}
\end{figure}

What 
if I 
type
something                            like this.

If I want an inline equation I use $y = x + 1$.  But if I want a centered equation I use $$y = x + 1$$ and it puts it on its own line. Maybe I want to refer to Equation \ref{eqn:simple}.

This is another equation
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:simple}
    y = \frac{x^{5e} + 1}{\partial x}
\end{equation}
embedded in a sentence.

This is another equation
\begin{align} 
2x - 5y &=  8 ,&x > 2\\    3x + 9y &=  -12 ,& y <1
\end{align}

embedded in a sentence.

And then we'll do some other stuff.
\end{proof}
\end{problem}
